        <div>
            I implemented a computational geometry algorithm and turned it into a game. The object of the game is to nagivate your way around a <i>dark maze</i>,
            and when you get to the end, you have to get back to where you started.... faster than the time you took to get there. So make sure you remember your way as you
            navigate around!
            <br>
            You have a few seconds of memory to represent what you've just seen, but that disappears after a bit, so you have to remember your way around the polygon.
            <br>
            Control your player by dragging your mouse around the maze.

        <h3> Visibility Polygons </h3>
        <div>
            The visibility polygon of a point with respect to a polygon is defined as all the points in the polygon that that point can "see". It's a pretty intuitive
            idea, but to implement a correct, general, fast algorithm to compute it is rather <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/163/lectures/163-chapter07.pdf">tricky</a>.

    <div><h3> An Alternative Algorithm </h3>
        <div>
            An alternate to this linear-time algorithm is explained <a href="http://ncase.me/sight-and-light/">here</a>. Essentially these are the steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                Cast a ray from the point to all vertices and record the first collision (<i>O(n)</i> for each vertex to get all the collisions, 
                for a total runtime of <i>O(n&sup2;)</i>)
                </li>
                <li>
                For all collisions, create 2 more collisions by shooting another ray +/- 0.000001 radians (for the walls behind any vertex).
                </li>
                <li>
                Sort all the collisions (<i>O(n log n)</i>) to piece together the polygon.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3> Linear algorithm explanation </h3>
        <div>
            Essentially, here is how the algorithm works:
            <br>
            (You can visually follow along <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/163/lectures/163-chapter07.pdf">here</a>)

            <br>
            <br>

            We do 4 instances of an algorithm that finds the visibility of a 90 degree cone, and stitch the visibility
            polygons (at all 4 angles; 0, 90, 180, and 270) together.

            First, we find the two points in the polygon where the 90 degree cone intersects an edge and add the player's point and
            those intersection points to a stack. This can be done in linear time by just looping through all the edges and seeing
            if the visibility cone intersects with that edge.
            Then, (without loss of generality, assume the polygon faces CCW) we walk linearly along the edges in a CCW direction.
            Assuming a convex polygon, this is all we need to do. If it's not convex, we may have more cases to check for.
            However, while the edges still face in a CCW direction with respect to the player, we can keep adding them to the stack.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the polygon enters an "upwards backtrack" (denoted by if an edge points in a CW direction with respect to
            the player and goes away from the player), we ignore edges until the algorithm emerges from the upwards backtrack, going CCW again, but this time
            above the edge that caused the upwards backtrack. When we find the emerging edge, we add a new window edge starting from
            the edge before the one that caused the upwards backtrack and ending at the emergence point that just became visible
            after returning from the upwards backtrack. Then, we resume walking in a CCW fashion and keep adding
            to the stack.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the polygon enters a "downwards backtrack" (denoted by if an edge points in a CW direction with respect to
            the player and faces towards the player), then the edge causing the downwards backtrack is covering up some edges, and
            we pop the edges that are completely covered from the stack, and add a window edge that intersects with the edge that
            is only <i>partially</i> covered by the downwards backtrack. Then, we resume walking in a CCW fashion and keep adding
            to the stack.. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There are more cases for what the polygon can do (such as a downwards backtrack crossing a window, in which case we need
            to slightly modify the case we're dealing with), but these cases are better described on the class slides <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/163/lectures/163-chapter07.pdf">here</a>.

            <br>
            <br>
            When we reach the last intersection point, the stack represents the visibility polygon in a cone! Now we just need to
            calculate the visibility polygon 3 more times (after changing the angle by 90 degrees) and stitch it together,
            and we have the entire visibility region of that point.
            <br>
            <br>
            Clearly, this algorithm is linear with respect to the number of edges of the polygon, becauase it takes linear time
            to find the intersection points, and takes linear time to walk along the edge list of the polygon sequentially, and
            potentially push/pop edges to/from the stack (at most once per edge).

        <h3>Some bugs I ran into</h3>
        <div>
            One problem I ran into was trying to implement the stack using points rather than edges, and then
            just use the stack as the parameter for the polygon creation. Because the algorithm so heavily
            relies on certain information about edges (like which direction an edge points), the point stack idea
            messed up my logic in code, even though the two are technically equivalent (we can determine the "next
            edge" we're looking at by just peeking ahead in the point list of the polygon). After about
            a week of messing around with convoluted point logic, I fixed my implementation by pretty
            much starting from scratch and using an edge stack. It took me only a few hours to get back the progress
            I had made previously, and was done with the entire algorithm within a few days after that. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Another problem I encountered was with the upwards backtrack mode, as described above. We emerge from the upwards
            backtrack when we return from the polygon's edges with an edge facing CCW with respect to the player. However,
            if the polygon first loops back around CW and <i>then</i> comes back in a CCW direction, as denoted here,
            <div>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xOPSpU7.png"/>
            </div>
            then this edge is invisible to the player. To solve this, I just created a stack that I pushed
            CW-faced edges on (represented by the grey CW facing edge that intersects with the orange visibility ray), and
            popped when I encountered the CCW-facing visibility ray, denoted by the blue CCW facing edge that has the
            crossed out symbol over it.
            When the stack is empty, that means the edge is now visible - all CW-facing edges have
            been accounted for. (This works because 
            of the Jordan curve theorem - the polygon has to come back around.)
            <br>
            This is just one example of the many edge cases that you have to deal with when implementing the visibility
            polygon algorithm.
